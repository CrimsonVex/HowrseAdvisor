# HowrseAdvisor

*developer's notes*
  - Hey there! This is a chrome extension that allows some small improvements to interacting with horses on Howrse. 
  - I made this to help with AP farming mostly, but it can also be helpful for other interactions.
  - After installing the extension, the Key Features will be enabled by default and the optional features will be disabled by default.
  - Settings can be toggled by clicking the extension icon.
  - This project will remain open-sourced for peace of mind
