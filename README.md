# HowrseAdvisor

Hey there! This is a chrome extension that allows some small improvements to interacting with horses on Howrse. 
I made this to help with AP farming mostly, but it can also be helpful for other interactions.

Key Features:
* Auto-scaling feature for feeding, which is the same as the VIP perk "Get the right amount of food preselected for your horses"
* Auto-groom and auto-sleep after feeding the horse

Optional:
* Auto-mission after feeding the horse
* Auto-enroll in the cheapest Equestrian Center for 3 days

** INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION **

* CHROME INSTRUCTIONS *
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Click "Load unpacked"
3. Select the HowrseAdvisor folder
4. Enable/Pin the extension, if desired
5. You're good to go!

*footnote
  After installing the extension, the Key Features will be enabled by default and the optional features will be disabled by default.
  Settings can be toggled by clicking the extension icon.
